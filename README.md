# Teraparsec Inc Upwork Screening:

Your task is to implement a simple magnetizing bubble:

This buble will need to be able to be dragged from the initial location to a defined “drop zone”, marked by a view with a blue border. 
Upon dropping the bubble in this area, the bubble must magnetize to the center of the drop zone, changing the border color of the drop zone.
The bubble must also be able to be picked up, and moved out of the magnetizing zone
Dropping anywhere outside of the drop zone will result in the bubble springing back to its initial location

We’ve already created a boilerplate application with the necessary stylesheets and locational components for you to work on. All you need to do is turn the static DragObject view into a panresponder, and implement the magnetize logic. We are just looking for an extremely basic result, this task should not take more than 1 hour to complete.
